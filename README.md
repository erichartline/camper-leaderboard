FCC challenge.

Live Demo: Coming soon

Built with React.

User Stories:
* I can see a table of the freeCodeCamp campers who've earned the most brownie points in the past 30 days.
* I can see how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days, and how many they've earned total.
* I can toggle between sorting the list by how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days and by how many brownie points they've earned total.
