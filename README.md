# Camper Leaderboard
Points leaderboard for freeCodeCamp users. Can be sorted by recent or all-time points.

Live Demo: [http://fcc-camper-leaderboard.surge.sh/](http://fcc-camper-leaderboard.surge.sh/)

Built with React, Redux and Sass.

User Stories:
* I can see a table of the freeCodeCamp campers who've earned the most brownie points in the past 30 days.
* I can see how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days, and how many they've earned total.
* I can toggle between sorting the list by how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days and by how many brownie points they've earned total.
